## What is this?

This is a tool to help you learn common words/expressions by visualizing what is happening. It is currently done for the Dutch language. Maybe in the future it will be extended to other languages. 

## How is it split?

The `index.html` file contains pictures of different situations/object categories and points to another html file containing hotspots. Whenever the mouse is hovered over a hotspot it shows information about it.

## Upcoming

- Body type: Click button to show all elements without having to hover over them;
- Load the tooltip data from JS instead of HTML
